# RustViz
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

*RustViz* is a tool written in Rust that generate visualization from simple Rust programs to assist potential users and students in better understanding the Rust [Lifetime and Borrowing](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-02-references-and-borrowing.html) mechanism.

## What does it look like?

*RustViz* generates *.svg* files of graphical indicators that integrate with [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) to generate visualization over user-defined rust code examples. Here's a sample view of what the visualization looks like:

## Usage (example)
*RustViz* is capable of visualizing simple rust codes (refer to the restriction section) via user definition. In this section we'll showcase how to generate some default visulization example that has been provided by us.

*RustViz* requires [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), Cargo and [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) to be installed. Once you have installed all the above prerequisites, direct into the */test_example* folder and run *test_examples.sh*
```
./test_examples.sh
```
You may have the following output:
```

```
If you observed this output, then you have successfully generated the rust visulization examples! Now open your brower and browse into *http://localhost:8000/*. You should be able to view all the examples by selecting each from the list bar on the left. To enable visulization, toggle the swtich that is included in the code section.

Great! Now you've know how to generate and view the visualization that you could create by using *RustViz*, Now let's create one of your own!
